Cybersecurity: The practice of protecting information resources from unauthorized use.

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) 

  - Confidentiality: The secrecy of the information within the asset being protected only accessible to authorized people, systems, or processes.
    Ex : 
  - Integrity: Keeping information correct and unaltered, preventing unauthorized changes.

  Verification:

  single-factor authentication:
  two-factor authentication:

    Types:

      2.something you have
        Ex:smart card
      3.something you are
        Ex:biometric fingerprint

4. Types of Security Controls

Administrative Controls

Technical Controls (aka Logical Controls)

Technical Data Security Controls (e.g., encryption at rest/in transit)

Technical Access Controls (e.g., MFA, biometrics, permissions)

Network Security Controls (e.g., IDS, IPS, firewalls, antivirus, SIEM)

Physical Controls

Examples: locks, mantraps, surveillance cameras, badge readers, alarms, lighting, bollards, fire extinguishers
