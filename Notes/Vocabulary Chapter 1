Key Vocabulary from Chapter 1: "Security Principles"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======================
1. Fundamental Concepts
======================= 

Cybersecurity: The practice of protecting information resources from unauthorized use.

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability): 

  - Confidentiality: The secrecy of the information within the asset being protected only accessible to authorized people, systems, or processes.

    Ex : A hospital stores patient medical records in a database. To ensure confidentiality, only doctors and nurses directly involved in a patient’s care are granted access to those records.
         Access is controlled using role-based access control (RBAC) and protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA). If an unauthorized person—such as a receptionist or an outsider—tries to 
         view the patient’s medical history, the system denies access. This protects sensitive information (like diagnoses or treatments) from disclosure to anyone who doesn’t have a legitimate need to know.

  - Integrity: Keeping information correct and unaltered, preventing unauthorized changes.

    Ex : An online retail company stores customer orders in its database. To ensure integrity, the system uses checksums and hashing to verify that order details (such as product IDs, quantities, and shipping addresses)
         are not altered during transmission between the customer’s browser and the company’s servers.If a hacker tries to intercept the data and change the order (for example, modifying the quantity of items or changing
         the delivery address), the hash values will no longer match. The system will detect the tampering and reject the modified data, preserving the accuracy and trustworthiness of the records.

  - Availability: Ensures that systems, data, and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed.

    Ex : A financial institution provides online banking services to its customers. To ensure availability, the bank uses redundant servers in different geographic locations and employs load balancers to distribute traffic.
         If one data center experiences a power outage or hardware failure, customer requests are automatically rerouted to a backup site. This prevents downtime and ensures that customers can still log in, transfer funds, and
         pay bills without interruption.


Access Control: Processes, tools, or coonfugur5ation settings that ensure that access to data is restricted to only those individuals whao are authorized to access it.

Authentication: The method which systems verify that a user whos is requesting access to a resource really is who they claim to be.

  Identification: The first step in the access control process of claiming or asserting an identity within a system where a user provides a unique identifier—such as a username, ID number, or smart card—to declare who they are before authentication and authorization occur.
    Ex : When an employee logs into a company’s secure portal, they type in their username (e.g., j.smith@company.com). This action identifies the user to the system.

  Verification: The process of confirming that information, data, or an action is correct, accurate, and valid. Also is often used to check the authenticity of user credentials, the integrity of data, or that security controls are working as intended.
                It ensures that what is presented or transmitted is trustworthy and unchanged.
    Ex : When a user enters their password during login, the system verifies it by comparing the entered password’s hash against the stored hash in the database. If they match, the password is confirmed as valid.

  single-factor authentication: The use of one authentication factor.
  two-factor authentication: The use of two authentication factors. 
  multifactor authentication: The use of multiple (two or more) factors of authentication.

    Types:
      1.something you know
        Ex: password
      2.something you have
        Ex:smart card
      3.something you are
        Ex:biometric fingerprint

Message Authenticity: Message Authenticity is the assurance that a message truly comes from the claimed sender and has not been altered in transit. 
                      It confirms the source of the information and often relies on techniques such as digital signatures, certificates, and encryption.

    Ex : A company’s CEO sends an email approving a financial transaction. To ensure message authenticity, the email is digitally signed with the CEO’s private key.
         When the finance team receives the email, their system uses the CEO’s public key to verify the digital signature. If it matches, they can trust that the message 
         was genuinely sent by the CEO and has not been modified.

Nonrepudiation: Ensures a person or a system cannot deny actions they performed.
    Ex : Sending a message or signing a document.

Privacy: The ability of an individual or entity to hide information about themselves from others.

Information Assurance: The measure of information security or the extent to which information security is achieved or implemented.

2. Cyberattack Fundamentals
============================

Elements of a Typical Cyberattack:

    1. Conduct Research: An attack to gather as much information as possible about the target to be able to carry out the attack.
          - Domain Names
          - Corporate and Financial Information
          - Names of Employees and key Managers
          - E-mail addresses and phone numbers
          - Social media activity and friends
          - Facility locations and layouts
          - Ingress/Egress details

    2. Identify Targets: Attacker attempts to identify specific targets such as people, organizations, departments, facilities, capabilities, data, vendor names, and information systems.
                         Gathering all their information assets and their vilnerabilities that can be exploited.

    3. Exploit Targets: Attackers design and execute attacks by probing and taking advantage of specific vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the enterprise.
          - Phishing: Obtaining sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trusted entity, usually in e-mails.
          - Fake Websites: Used for harvesting sensitive information (credentials)
          - Malware: Software that intentionally is harmful and malicious.
          - Virus: A type of malware that is usually hidden inside another application.
          - Trojan: A virus disguised as something useful.
          - Worm: A virus that propagates itself to other systems.
          - Rootkit: A virus that hides itself by modifying the operating system.
          - Social Engineering: Tricking someone into doing something that is not in their best interest.
          - Scripting: Manipulating data entered into fields to produce unintended results.
          - Vulnerability-specific attacks: Exploiting software defects.

    4. Do Bad Things: The attacker gains access and do variety things to expand access laterally throughout the network to explore and discovermore systems and data to gain deeper access and
                      perform more attacks.
          - Stealing Data (compromise of confidentiality)
          - Modifying Data (compromise of integrity)
          - Destroying Data (compromise of availability)

3. Security Program Components
==============================

Risk Management: The ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to an organization’s information systems, followed by implementing strategies to reduce those risks to an acceptable level.
                 It ensures that security decisions are based on business objectives, threat likelihood, potential impact, and available resources.
      Ex: An organization identifies that storing customer data on an outdated server creates a high risk of data loss due to hardware failure. As part of risk management, the company decides to migrate the data to a 
          secure cloud service with redundancy and backup features, thereby reducing the risk to an acceptable level.
