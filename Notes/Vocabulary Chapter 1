Key Vocabulary from Chapter 1: "Security Principles"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======================
1. Fundamental Concepts
======================= 

Cybersecurity: The practice of protecting information resources from unauthorized use.

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability): 

  - Confidentiality: The secrecy of the information within the asset being protected only accessible to authorized people, systems, or processes.

    Ex : A hospital stores patient medical records in a database. To ensure confidentiality, only doctors and nurses directly involved in a patient’s care are granted access to those records.
         Access is controlled using role-based access control (RBAC) and protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA). If an unauthorized person—such as a receptionist or an outsider—tries to 
         view the patient’s medical history, the system denies access. This protects sensitive information (like diagnoses or treatments) from disclosure to anyone who doesn’t have a legitimate need to know.

  - Integrity: Keeping information correct and unaltered, preventing unauthorized changes.

    Ex : An online retail company stores customer orders in its database. To ensure integrity, the system uses checksums and hashing to verify that order details (such as product IDs, quantities, and shipping addresses)
         are not altered during transmission between the customer’s browser and the company’s servers.If a hacker tries to intercept the data and change the order (for example, modifying the quantity of items or changing
         the delivery address), the hash values will no longer match. The system will detect the tampering and reject the modified data, preserving the accuracy and trustworthiness of the records.

  - Availability: Ensures that systems, data, and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed.

    Ex : A financial institution provides online banking services to its customers. To ensure availability, the bank uses redundant servers in different geographic locations and employs load balancers to distribute traffic.
         If one data center experiences a power outage or hardware failure, customer requests are automatically rerouted to a backup site. This prevents downtime and ensures that customers can still log in, transfer funds, and
         pay bills without interruption.


Access Control: Processes, tools, or coonfugur5ation settings that ensure that access to data is restricted to only those individuals whao are authorized to access it.

Authentication: The method which systems verify that a user whos is requesting access to a resource really is who they claim to be.

  Identification: The first step in the access control process of claiming or asserting an identity within a system where a user provides a unique identifier—such as a username, ID number, or smart card—to declare who they are before authentication and authorization occur.
    Ex : When an employee logs into a company’s secure portal, they type in their username (e.g., j.smith@company.com). This action identifies the user to the system.

  Verification: The process of confirming that information, data, or an action is correct, accurate, and valid. Also is often used to check the authenticity of user credentials, the integrity of data, or that security controls are working as intended.
                It ensures that what is presented or transmitted is trustworthy and unchanged.
    Ex : When a user enters their password during login, the system verifies it by comparing the entered password’s hash against the stored hash in the database. If they match, the password is confirmed as valid.

  single-factor authentication: The use of one authentication factor.
  two-factor authentication: The use of two authentication factors. 
  multifactor authentication: The use of multiple (two or more) factors of authentication.

    Types:
      1.something you know
        Ex: password
      2.something you have
        Ex:smart card
      3.something you are
        Ex:biometric fingerprint

Message Authenticity: Message Authenticity is the assurance that a message truly comes from the claimed sender and has not been altered in transit. 
                      It confirms the source of the information and often relies on techniques such as digital signatures, certificates, and encryption.

    Ex : A company’s CEO sends an email approving a financial transaction. To ensure message authenticity, the email is digitally signed with the CEO’s private key.
         When the finance team receives the email, their system uses the CEO’s public key to verify the digital signature. If it matches, they can trust that the message 
         was genuinely sent by the CEO and has not been modified.

Nonrepudiation: Ensures a person or a system cannot deny actions they performed.
    Ex : Sending a message or signing a document.

Privacy: The ability of an individual or entity to hide information about themselves from others.

Information Assurance: The measure of information security or the extent to which information security is achieved or implemented.

2. Cyberattack Fundamentals
============================

Elements of a Typical Cyberattack:

    1. Conduct Research: An attack to gather as much information as possible about the target to be able to carry out the attack.
          - Domain Names
          - Corporate and Financial Information
          - Names of Employees and key Managers
          - E-mail addresses and phone numbers
          - Social media activity and friends
          - Facility locations and layouts
          - Ingress/Egress details

    2. Identify Targets: Attacker attempts to identify specific targets such as people, organizations, departments, facilities, capabilities, data, vendor names, and information systems.
                         Gathering all their information assets and their vilnerabilities that can be exploited.

    3. Exploit Targets: Attackers design and execute attacks by probing and taking advantage of specific vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the enterprise.
          - Phishing: Obtaining sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trusted entity, usually in e-mails.
          - Fake Websites: Used for harvesting sensitive information (credentials)
          - Malware: Software that intentionally is harmful and malicious.
          - Virus: A type of malware that is usually hidden inside another application.
          - Trojan: A virus disguised as something useful.
          - Worm: A virus that propagates itself to other systems.
          - Rootkit: A virus that hides itself by modifying the operating system.
          - Social Engineering: Tricking someone into doing something that is not in their best interest.
          - Scripting: Manipulating data entered into fields to produce unintended results.
          - Vulnerability-specific attacks: Exploiting software defects.

    4. Do Bad Things: The attacker gains access and do variety things to expand access laterally throughout the network to explore and discovermore systems and data to gain deeper access and
                      perform more attacks.
          - Stealing Data (compromise of confidentiality)
          - Modifying Data (compromise of integrity)
          - Destroying Data (compromise of availability)

3. Security Program Components
==============================

Risk Management: The ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to an organization’s information systems, followed by implementing strategies to reduce those risks to an acceptable level.
                 It ensures that security decisions are based on business objectives, threat likelihood, potential impact, and available resources.
      Ex: An organization identifies that storing customer data on an outdated server creates a high risk of data loss due to hardware failure. As part of risk management, the company decides to migrate the data to a 
          secure cloud service with redundancy and backup features, thereby reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

Security Governance and Management:The framework of policies, procedures, and processes that guide how an organization establishes, implements, and monitors its information security program.
      - Governance: Governance provides the direction and oversight from senior leadership to ensure security aligns with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and risk tolerance.
      - Management: Management is the execution of those policies through day-to-day operations, controls, and monitoring.

    Ex: A company’s board of directors (governance) mandates compliance with industry regulations such as HIPAA for protecting health data. The IT security team (management) then creates access 
        control policies, trains employees on handling sensitive data, and deploys monitoring tools to ensure compliance and reduce risk.

Security Controls: Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures whether administrative, technical, or physical implemented to protect an organization’s information systems and data. Their purpose is to reduce risk, enforce 
                   security policies, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.

    Ex: An organization enforces multi-factor authentication (MFA) (a technical control) for remote access. This helps prevent unauthorized users from logging into the system even if a password is stolen, thereby reducing the risk of a data breach.

Professional Ethics: Professional ethics refers to the standards of behavior, integrity, and responsibility that cybersecurity professionals are expected to uphold when performing their duties. It ensures that security practitioners act honestly, protect
                     sensitive information, avoid conflicts of interest, follow laws and regulations, and prioritize the trust and safety of stakeholders. Ethical conduct builds credibility and reinforces the security profession. 

    Ex: A cybersecurity analyst discovers a critical vulnerability in a company’s system. Instead of exploiting or selling this information, the analyst follows proper disclosure procedures and reports it through internal channels so it can be fixed—demonstrating professional ethics.

Compromise: is the unauthorized disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of data, or the loss of control over an information system. It occurs when a threat actor successfully bypasses security measures, leading to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or 
            availability (CIA) of information.

    Ex: An attacker gains access to an employee’s email account through a phishing attack. The attacker then reads sensitive internal communications and uses the account to send malicious emails. This situation represents a compromise of the organization’s email system.

Vulnerability: is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, process, or control that could be exploited by a threat actor to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of information. Vulnerabilities can result from misconfigurations, coding errors, lack of 
               security controls, or human mistakes.

    Ex: A web application has a coding flaw that allows SQL injection. If an attacker discovers and exploits this vulnerability, they could gain unauthorized access to the organization’s customer database.


    1. Application Vulnerabilities: is a flaw, weakness, or misconfiguration in software that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt the application’s normal functions.

    2. Unpatched Systems: are devices, applications, or software that have known security flaws because updates, patches, or fixes from the vendor have not been applied.

    3. Misconfigured Devices: are systems, applications, or network components that have incorrect, incomplete, or insecure settings, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access or exploitation. These misconfigurations often occur due to default passwords, open ports, excessive permissions, or 
       failure to apply proper security policies.

    4. Improperly Trained Users: are individuals within an organization who lack sufficient knowledge of security policies, procedures, and best practices. This lack of training increases the risk of human error, social engineering attacks, and unintentional violations of security controls, making users 
       one of the most common points of failure in cybersecurity.

Vulnerability Assessment: is a systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing security weaknesses in an organization’s systems, applications, or networks. The goal is to detect vulnerabilities before they can be exploited and to recommend remediation or mitigation strategies to reduce risk.

Threat: is any potential danger or event that can exploit a vulnerability in an information system, application, or network, potentially causing harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of data. Threats can be intentional (malicious attacks) or unintentional (natural disasters, human error).

    2. Social Engineering

    3. Natural Disasters

    4. Physical Intrusion

Threat Actors: are individuals, groups, or entities that intentionally or unintentionally carry out actions that can exploit vulnerabilities to harm an organization’s information systems, data, or networks. They can be classified based on their motives, capabilities, or origin, such as hackers, insiders, hacktivists, or nation-state actors.

    1. Cyber Criminals (hackers)

    2. Criminal Groups

    3. Nation-States

    4. Terroist Groups

    5. Insiders

Risk: is the potential for loss, damage, or harm to an organization’s information systems, data, or operations, resulting from the combination of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. It is typically assessed based on the likelihood of the event occurring and the potential impact on the organization.

Exposure: is the state of being open to potential harm or loss due to a vulnerability or weakness in an information system, network, or process. It represents the possibility that sensitive data, resources, or systems could be accessed, damaged, or compromised by a threat actor.

Security Control (Countermeasure): is any administrative, technical, or physical safeguard implemented to reduce risk, protect assets, and enforce security policies. Controls are designed to prevent, detect, or correct security incidents, helping maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.

-ISC² advocates a three-step risk management process:

    1. Risk identification (framing the risk)

    2. Risk assessment (understanding the risk)

    3. Risk treatment (taking action on what to do about the risk)

Risk Identification: is the process of systematically recognizing and documenting potential threats, vulnerabilities, and exposures that could negatively impact an organization’s information systems, data, or operations. This step is the foundation of risk management, as it allows organizations to understand what risks exist before
                     assessing or mitigating them.

Risk Assessment: is the process of evaluating identified risks by analyzing the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact it could have on an organization. It helps prioritize which risks need to be addressed first and guides decision-making on appropriate security controls.

    - Quantitative Risk Assessment: is a method of evaluating risk using numerical values to estimate the likelihood of a threat and the potential financial or operational impact of its occurrence. This approach provides measurable data to help organizations make informed decisions about risk mitigation and resource allocation.

          AV x EF = SLE
          Asset Value x Exposure Factor = Single Loss Expectancy

          SLE x ARO = ALE
          Single Loss Expectancy x Annualized Rate of Occurrence = Annualized Loss Expectency

    - Qualitative Risk Assesment: is a method of evaluating risks based on non-numeric criteria, such as probability levels, severity, or impact ratings (e.g., high, medium, low). This approach uses expert judgment, historical data, and scenario analysis to prioritize risks when precise numerical data is unavailable.


Quantitative Methods:

    1. Asset Value

    2. Threat Probability

    3. Vulnerability

    4. Impact of Loss

    5. Cost of countermeasures or controls
